# Industriae Mutatio
As of writing this, Industriae Mutatio is in the early stages of development.

## What is the goal of this project?
The ultimate goal of this project is to create a comprehensive tech mod for modern minecraft versions which completely turns the game into a technological masterpiece, all while keeping the original creative & adventurous aspects known and loved by millions.

### Features 
**assume all to be "not implemented" at this stage**
- Plenty of classic single block machines which cary out the brunt of processing from multiplying ores to building advanced circuitry
- A wide selection of multi-block machines to cary out the processes more efficiently and effectively
- A comprehensive set of logistical mechanisms (fluids/energy/items) to allow for greater automation and storage through all stages of progression
- One rather key element of Industriae Mutatio is that of it's power system which is an extended RF/FE implementation to fit a more complex power system
- A Wiki/Guide (both in-game & external) which is actually useful and can help you progress through the mod
- Full JEI support for machines (including multi-blocks and structures) to make for an uninterrupted play-through experience
- 1.15+ Texture styles to fit seamlessly fit into then surroundings 
- Fully "Data Pack Supported" recipe systems to allow for the easy tweaks and changes for mod Pack development
