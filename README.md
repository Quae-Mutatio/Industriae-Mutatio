# Industriae Mutatio
As of writing this, Industriae Mutatio is in the early stages of development.

## What is the goal of this project?
The ultimate goal of Industriae Mutatio is to bring the extremely in-depth and detailed GregTech mod series to the modern modded minecraft scene.

As a Team (Quae Mutatio) we want to capture the best parts of GregTech and create a modern version which can be enjoyed by masses.

### Features 
**assume all to be "not implemented" at this stage**
  - [ ] Plenty of classic single block machines which cary out the brunt of processing from ores to circuits
  - [ ] A wide selection of multi-block machines to cary out the processes more efficiently and effectively
  - [ ] A comprehensive set of logistical mechanisms (fluids/energy/items) to allow for greater automation and storage through all stages of progression
  - [ ] One rather key element of Industriae Mutatio is that of it's power system, which is simple and extended RF/FE implementation
  - [ ] A Wiki/Guide (both in-game & external) which is actually useful and can help you progress through the mod without having to hunt for hours to find yet another out-dated video on youtube.
  - [ ] Full JEI support for machines (including multi-blocks and structures) to make for an uninterrupted play-through experience
  - [ ] An up to date set of textures (Yes we ain't gonna copy the original ones from Greg Tech "cause pls no")
  - [ ] Fully "Data Pack Supported" recipe systems to allow for the easy tweaks and changes for mod Pack development
